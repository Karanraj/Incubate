	No.  triggers require a known execution time since the rest of the record update sequence is on hold until a trigger exits.   You have to put the @future in an apex class -- which you can call from a trigger.  However, you have to make sure the trigger code, workflow rules, and assignment rules do not depend on the results of the @future.
